        <h2>Brief About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a passionate and multifaceted individual with a deep love for
          teaching, mentoring children and young adults, and sharing knowledge.
          My dedication to guiding and inspiring others extends beyond academics
          into areas like preaching the Bible, which aligns with my faith and
          core values.
        </p>

        <p>
          I enjoy designing and planning, bringing creativity and structure to
          everything I do. My enthusiasm for learning and practicing new skills
          fuels my constant growth, especially in the field of technology.
          Coding and building web software applications are key aspects of my
          journey, and I'm are currently advancing my expertise in web
          development.
        </p>

        <p>
          Academically, I studied Electrical/Electronic Engineering at Kumasi
          Polytechnic before transitioning into the business world, earning an
          International Diploma in Business from NCC UK, facilitated by Data
          Link University in Tema, Ghana. I graduated with first degree from
          Regent University College of Science and Technology, Accra where I
          later worked for 6 years as a Cyber Campus Administrator responsible
          for managing and overseeing the digital learning platforms, and online
          services in the university. My primary role was to ensure that
          students, faculty, and staff have seamless access to online education,
          communication tools, and digital resources.
        </p>

        <p>
          I continued to take some online courses in Data Analysis and Data
          Science and Machine Learning. I am currently working with the Civic
          and Local Government in the Oti Region of Ghana as an Managment
          Information System (MIS) officer.
        </p>

        <p>
          Beyond academics, I have a vibrant personality with diverse interests.
          I enjoy watching drama and action movies, listening to and playing
          musical instruments, and sightseeing.
